# BOJ Algorithm Study

Solving algorithm problems to improve coding skills.
The file names were formatted as "(problem number)(algorithm_type)(difficulty)."
The difficulty is based on the problem's tier, listed as follows (from easiest to hardest):

Bronze(B), Silver(S), Gold(G), Platinum(P), Diamond(D), Ruby(R), Master(M).

A lower number within each tier indicates a higher difficulty (e.g., Gold 1 is harder than Gold 5).

## How I Solve Problems
- Write clean and efficient C++ code
- Focus on understanding problem-solving techniques
- Summarize key points or mistakes after solving each problem

## Tools
- Language: C++
